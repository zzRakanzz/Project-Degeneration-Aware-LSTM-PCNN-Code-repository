# Project-Degeneration-Aware-LSTM-PCNN-Code-repository
A repository for storing code related to the A Degeneration-Aware LSTM-PCNN Fusion Network for Predicting Abrasive Water Jet's Separation Speed paper
We have uploaded the relevant training codes for DaLSTM, the benchmark model DNN and LSTM models, as well as the trained and frozen model weights
Some parameter names need to be modified a second time during use. This part of the code is for reference only
